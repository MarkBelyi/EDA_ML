    "\n",
    "First, you'll need to install the MLflow Python package. I recommend following these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a new Python environment (preferably using conda):\n",
    "   ```bash\n",
    "   conda create -n mlflow_env python=3.9 or python=3.10\n",
    "   conda activate mlflow_env\n",
    "\n",
    "After installing the package, run this command: ``mlflow --version`` to verify the installation.\n",
    "Question: What version of MLflow did you install?"

    "1. Get the data:\n",
    "  * Download Green Taxi data for Q1 2023 (Jan-Mar) in parquet format\n",
    "  * Link to data: [NYC Taxi Data Portal](https://www1.nyc.gov/site/tlc/about/tlc-trip-record-data.page)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Run preprocessing:\n",
    "  * Find `preprocess_data.py` script\n",
    "  * This script will:\n",
    "    - Read taxi data from your download folder\n",
    "    - Transform features using `DictVectorizer` (trained on January data)\n",
